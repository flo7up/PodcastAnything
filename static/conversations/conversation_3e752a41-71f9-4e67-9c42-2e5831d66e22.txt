**Speaker1:** Welcome to today’s podcast! We're diving into a very exciting topic: the AI Design Offer and its significance for businesses implementing AI solutions. It's a game-changer for anyone looking to leverage AI capabilities through Azure services.

**Speaker2:** Absolutely! This offer is particularly intriguing because it combines Azure AI, Data, and App Services to solve real business problems. Not only does it support the AI Design Wins initiative, but it also promises an aggressive 3x return on investment. Could you break that down for us a bit more?

**Speaker1:** Sure! The offer supports the AI Design Wins initiative and includes Executive Customer Innovation Funds (ECIF) and Azure Consumption Offer (ACO). Customers also receive Unified Enhanced Solutions and Skilling, among other benefits. Essentially, it's a win-win for both businesses and partners.

**Speaker2:** Right, and it's interesting to see just how comprehensive it is. The eligibility criteria are also quite specific. To qualify, opportunities need to drive consumption across AI, Apps, and Data. For enterprise clients, we're looking at a minimum of $15k incremental in Azure Consumed Revenue (ACR) for three consecutive months. For SMC customers, the threshold is $3k. 

**Speaker1:** That's correct. Essentially, for Enterprise, the deal size needs to be at least $45k in 1-year ACR, while for SMC, it's $9k. It’s all about ensuring a holistic adoption of Azure services.

**Speaker2:** So, if a customer’s deal includes Partner Technology Units (PTUs), should they go for the AI Design Offer?

**Speaker1:** Good question. Yes, the AI Design Offer is actually a better fit for deals with PTUs. It offers a more aggressive ROI at 3x and can potentially provide higher funding, up to $500k, as long as all the other requirements are met.

**Speaker2:** Now, what if one or more of their workloads don’t meet the $5k threshold for Enterprise or $1K for SMC?

**Speaker1:** In that case, they won't be eligible for the AI Design Offer. However, they might still qualify for the Azure Innovate Standard ECIF Offer, which offers a 5x ROI.

**Speaker2:** Interesting. Switching gears a bit, let's talk about the AI Design Win initiative. What's the big idea there?

**Speaker1:** The initiative aims to identify use cases and technical patterns that drive business transformation, acting essentially as a precursor to revenue. Its goal is to push for quality design wins that quickly achieve the ACR thresholds across AI, Apps, and Data.

**Speaker2:** So, it’s more about setting the stage for larger transformations rather than just delivering specific solutions?

**Speaker1:** Exactly. It's about discovering and validating AI's potential to transform business processes. It's different from traditional solution plays, which focus on specific solutions like Build and Modernize AI Apps and Innovate with the AI Platform.

**Speaker2:** What are the expectations in terms of design wins and customers?

**Speaker1:** The target is that at least 50% of the accounts have one AI design win. For design customers, the goal is 8 in H1 and 16 by the end of the fiscal year. These customers need to hit the ACR thresholds.

**Speaker2:** And if a customer’s existing consumption before July plays a role, how does that impact the count?

**Speaker1:** Good point. The ACR count starts from zero beginning in July. So, any consumption before that doesn't count towards the AI Design Win threshold.

**Speaker2:** So, partners can gain some enhanced funding and skilling benefits through Azure Innovate, right?

**Speaker1:** Exactly. Eligible partners in the field-led program can see an improvement from a 1:5 to a 1:3 funding rate. It's really designed to encourage both partners and customers to engage more deeply with AI solutions.

**Speaker2:** This sounds highly beneficial for both. But how does the nomination process work for partners?

**Speaker1:** Nomination depends on the T-Shirt Size of Azure Innovate components. For sizes below L, partners can nominate customers via the partner portal. For Size L, they need to go through their Partner Development Managers (PDMs).

**Speaker2:** And what is an AI Design WinWire?

**Speaker1:** It's an internal Microsoft email that highlights the use case, value proposition, and architecture that qualified a project as an AI Design Win. It’s used to validate and track these wins.

**Speaker2:** But will this AI Design Win term be used in external communications?

**Speaker1:** Absolutely. The initiative will have an official external-facing name for customer interactions to create a clear and consistent identity.

**Speaker2:** Can partners track the status of their wins via the partner portal?

**Speaker1:** No, they can't track it directly through the portal. They’ll see progress once customers start using the required Azure services.

**Speaker2:** And can partners nominate managed services running in their own tenant?

**Speaker1:** Currently, that’s not supported because ACR does not count towards the customer's TPID in such cases.

**Speaker2:** What about marketplace offerings?

**Speaker1:** If they're deployed to the customer’s tenant, they do count towards the TPID and can be nominated.

**Speaker2:** So to summarize, the AI Design Offer is a robust package that helps implement AI solutions effectively while offering significant financial incentives and encouraging broad Azure service adoption.

**Speaker1:** Exactly. For detailed information, you can check out the AI Design Offer FAQ documents and other resources on SharePoint and Seismic.

**Speaker2:** Fascinating stuff. Thanks for breaking it down!

**Speaker1:** My pleasure! Thanks for tuning in, everyone. Until next time!
